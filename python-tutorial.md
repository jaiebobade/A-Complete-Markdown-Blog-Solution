## What is Python?

Python is a versatile programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.

## Setting Up Your Environment

To start coding in Python, you need to install Python on your computer. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Additionally, you might want to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

## Basic Syntax

Python syntax is designed to be readable and straightforward. Here are some basic elements:

```python
# This is a single-line comment
"""
  This is a multi-line comment
"""
message = 'Hello, World!'
print(message)
